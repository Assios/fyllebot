Is this the real life
Is this just fantasy?
Caught in a landslide
No escape from reality
Open your eyes
Look up to the skies and see
I'm just a poor boy
I need no sympathy
Because I'm easy come, easy go
little high, little low
Anyway the wind blows
doesn't really matter to me, to me
Mama, just killed a man
Put a gun against his head
Pulled my trigger, now he's dead
Mama, life had just begun
But now I've gone and thrown it all away
Mama, ooo
Didn't mean to make you cry
If I'm not back again this time tomorrow
Carry on, carry on, as if nothing really matters
HIiIIC*
When I wake up
yeah I know I'm gonna be, I'm gonna be the man who wakes up next to you
When I go out
yeah I know I'm gonna be, I'm gonna be the man who goes along with you
If I get drunk
yes I know I'm gonna be, I'm gonna be the man who gets drunk next to you
And if I haver
yeah I know I'm gonna be, I'm gonna be the man who's havering to you
But I would walk 500 miles
And I would walk 500 more
Just to be the man who walked 1000 miles
To fall down at your door
HUAAAC'
What shall we do with a drunken sailor?
EARLYYY IN THE MOOORNIN'
Jag kanner en bot
Han heter fyllebot. fyllebot heter han
og han kan banna
BANNA DIG SÅ HÅRT
Han rojer upp
i våååran kanaa-aaal
Jag vill beratta för dig att jag känner en bot
som alltid vaktar alla som är här
och som ser till att vi blir utan besvär
Det finns ingen take-over som lyckas
Kom ihåg att det ar jag som känner en bot
YHUUYAAA'
Always
I wanna beee with you, and make belieeeve with you. And live in harmony, harmony oooh

Sister, sister, solitude
Likes her swimming in the nude
Sometimes she is black and blue
Melody get over you, and your kisses
Sister, sister, solitude
Gettin' off on being nude
Wish I could get used to you
I would know just what to do, hits no misses
Yeah
Sweet like candy
Yeah I can be
Fake your beauty
Smiling sweetly
Yours completely
Fake your beauty
Baby, baby bubblegum
Tell me are we havin' fun
Never knew what I could do
To get really close to you, for no reason
Baby, baby bubblegum
Are we playing hit and run
You'll be singing last years song
Honey acting way too young, out of season
Yeah
Sweet like candy
Yeah I can be
Fake your beauty
Fool him slightly
Doors locked tightly
Fake your beauty
Sweet like candy
Yeah I can be
Fake you beauty
Fool him slightly
Doors locked tightly
Fake your beauty
Fake your beauty
Fake your beauty
Du var flink til å synge, fyllebot
God dag, mann!
Økseskaft
Kor langt er det til gjestgivaren?
Opp under denne kvisten
Kor er kjerringa di, mann?
Eg skulle tjørebreie henne, for ho ligg på stranda og er sprukken i begge endar.
Kor er dottera di?
Å, ho står på stallen og er føl-diger

I took your time
Like I've always been trying to
Trying to
Was out of mine
So easy for me to do
Yeah, to do
Just needed to be powerful and sweet
Just needed to make my world complete
Just needed more than you could give
I've got lots of fancy tricks
To make this last forever
Will you still remember
Twisted little star
Darker shining
Silently surrender
Twisted little smile
Twisted's gonna last a while
I made you weak
Like I know I am supposed to do
Yeah, to do
You never speak
Cause you know I don't want you to
Yeah, you do
Just needed someone fresh to hold my hand
Just needed someone new to understand
Just needed a face to ease the flow
There must be a million ways
To make this last forver
Just needed every smile that you could give
Just needed every lie that you could give
APPLAUSE
There are nine million bicycles in Beijing
That's a fact,
It's a thing we can't deny
Like the fact that I will love you till I die.
We are twelve billion light years from the edge,
That's a guess,
No-one can ever say it's true
But I know that I will always be with you.
I'm warmed by the fire of your love everyday
So don't call me a liar,
Just believe everything that I say
There are six BILLION people in the world
More or less
and it makes me feel quite small
But you're the one I love the most of all
We're high on the wire
With the world in our sight
And I'll never tire,
Of the love that you give me every night
There are nine million bicycles in Beijing
That's a Fact,
it's a thing we can't deny
Like the fact that I will love you till I die
And there are nine million bicycles in Beijing
And you know that I will love you till I die! 
AWESOMETIMEZZZ
