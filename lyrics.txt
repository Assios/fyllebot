Is this the real life
Is this just fantasy?
Caught in a landslide
No escape from reality
Open your eyes
Look up to the skies and see
I'm just a poor boy
I need no sympathy
Because I'm easy come, easy go
little high, little low
Anyway the wind blows
doesn't really matter to me, to me
Mama, just killed a man
Put a gun against his head
Pulled my trigger, now he's dead
Mama, life had just begun
But now I've gone and thrown it all away
Mama, ooo
Didn't mean to make you cry
If I'm not back again this time tomorrow
Carry on, carry on, as if nothing really matters
HIiIIC*
When I wake up
yeah I know I'm gonna be, I'm gonna be the man who wakes up next to you
When I go out
yeah I know I'm gonna be, I'm gonna be the man who goes along with you
If I get drunk
yes I know I'm gonna be, I'm gonna be the man who gets drunk next to you
And if I haver
yeah I know I'm gonna be, I'm gonna be the man who's havering to you
But I would walk 500 miles
And I would walk 500 more
Just to be the man who walked 1000 miles
To fall down at your door
HUAAAC'
What shall we do with a drunken sailor?
EARLYYY IN THE MOOORNIN'
Jag kanner en bot
Han heter fyllebot. fyllebot heter han
og han kan banna
BANNA DIG SÅ HÅRT
Han rojer upp
i våååran kanaa-aaal
Jag vill beratta för dig att jag känner en bot
som alltid vaktar alla som är här
och som ser till att vi blir utan besvär
Det finns ingen take-over som lyckas
Kom ihåg att det ar jag som känner en bot
YHUUYAAA'
Always
I wanna beee with you, and make belieeeve with you. And live in harmony, harmony oooh
HUHIDEIHICA!
God dag, mann!
Økseskaft
Kor langt er det til gjestgivaren?
Opp under denne kvisten
Kor er kjerringa di, mann?
Eg skulle tjørebreie henne, for ho ligg på stranda og er sprukken i begge endar.
Kor er dottera di?
Å, ho står på stallen og er føl-diger
APPLAUSE
There are nine million bicycles in Beijing
That's a fact,
It's a thing we can't deny
Like the fact that I will love you till I die.
We are twelve billion light years from the edge,
That's a guess,
No-one can ever say it's true
But I know that I will always be with you.
I'm warmed by the fire of your love everyday
So don't call me a liar,
Just believe everything that I say
There are six BILLION people in the world
More or less
and it makes me feel quite small
But you're the one I love the most of all
We're high on the wire
With the world in our sight
And I'll never tire,
Of the love that you give me every night
There are nine million bicycles in Beijing
That's a Fact,
it's a thing we can't deny
Like the fact that I will love you till I die
And there are nine million bicycles in Beijing
And you know that I will love you till I die! 
AWESOMETIMEZZZ
I threw a wish in the well
Don't ask me, I'll never tell
I looked to you as it fell
and now you're in my way
I trade my soul for a wish,
pennies and dimes for a kiss
I wasn't looking for this
but now you're in my way
Your stare was holdin', Ripped jeans, skin was showin'
Hot night, wind was blowin'
Where you think you're going, baby?
Hey, I just met you,
and this is crazy,
but here's my number,
call me maybe
I JUST MET YOOU, AND THIS IS CRAZEEEH. BUT HERE'S MY NUMAAAH. SO CALL ME, MAYBE? <3
These aren't the droids you're looking for.
These aren't the droids we're looking for.
SCHWUAAABz.
We were both young when I first saw you
I close my eyes
And the flashback starts
I'm standing there
On a balcony in summer air
See the lights
See the party, the ball gowns
I see you make your way through the crowd
And say hello, little did I know
That you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles
And my daddy said stay away from Juliet
And I was crying on the staircase
Begging you please don't go, and I said
Romeo take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story baby just say yes
